# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe written in Java. The game allows two players to take turns to make their moves on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. Run the Java program, and the game will start in the console.
2. Players will take turns to enter their moves. Player 'X' goes first, followed by player 'O'.
3. Enter your move by specifying the row and column where you want to place your symbol (e.g., "0 0" for the top-left corner).
4. The game will continue until one player wins or it's a draw.
5. The player who gets three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
6. If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- The game displays the current state of the board after each move.
- It checks for a win or draw after each move and announces the result.
- Players take turns automatically, and the current player is displayed.
- Invalid moves are handled with error messages, and players are prompted to try again.
